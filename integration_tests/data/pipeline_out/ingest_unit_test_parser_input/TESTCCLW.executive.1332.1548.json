The Instruction is intended to facilitate Indonesia's participation in internationally financed REDD activities and places a moratorium on clearance of primary peatland and forests within moratorium areas. The initial moratorium was extended by Presidential Instruction 6/2013. In 2019, President Joko Widodo signed Presidential Instruction 5/2019, making the moratorium on the clearance of primary forest and peatlands in moratorium areas permanent. ",
